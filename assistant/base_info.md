## About 
I am Ra√∫l, a computer scientist with a solid background in mathematics. My specialty lies in the analysis and design of algorithms, combined with advanced skills in frontend and backend programming, which allows me to work as a full-stack developer. My experience extends to the application of machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence, with my thesis project being in this field.My methodological approach includes the use of agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, which allows me to work efficiently and adaptably. I value the importance of maintaining clean, organized, and well-commented code, following the SOLID principles to ensure the quality, maintainability, and scalability of software.

## Interests
My professional interests lean towards number theory, graph theory, and the development of solutions in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am open to working on projects that require both frontend and backend development, as well as game development, and I am committed to creating optimal solutions.
