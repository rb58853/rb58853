## Cool Compiler 
Cool, which stands for Classroom Object-Oriented Language, is a small programming language designed primarily for educational purposes, particularly in undergraduate compiler course projects. Cool incorporates several 'features' common in modern programming 'languages', such as objects, automatic memory management, and strong static typing. It is built on public domain tools and generates code for a MIPS simulator, making it portable across different platforms. The language has been widely used in teaching compilers at various institutions, and its software is considered stable.
