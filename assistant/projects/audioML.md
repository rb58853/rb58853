# Audio Genre Classification
The classification of music genres plays a crucial role in modern digital audio signal processing applications. In this study, we propose several machine learning approaches to accurately categorize music tracks into predefined genres. Each approach uses different sets of 'features' that can be extracted from songs; ranging from common ones like MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) and direct audio signals to less explored 'features' in this context such as song lyrics and Wavelet Transform. To evaluate the models, we use the GTZAN reference dataset in the field. The results obtained highlight that song lyrics do not contribute much to classification, at least in the dataset used. The other models show results consistent with the state of the art, with an accuracy between 0.75 and 0.80.
