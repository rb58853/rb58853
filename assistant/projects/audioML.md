### Description

The Audio Genre Classification project aims to develop robust models for categorizing music tracks into predefined genres. Some key aspects of the project include:

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Implements multiple feature extraction techniques:
     - MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
     - Spectrograms
     - Conv1D features
     - Encoder-based features
     - Song lyrics analysis
   - Explores less common features like Wavelet Transform

2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Develops CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) models
   - Implements RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) models
   - Compares performance of different architectures

3. **Dataset**:
   - Utilizes the GTZAN reference dataset for evaluation
   - Analyzes dataset characteristics and limitations

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Conducts thorough evaluation of model performances
   - Reports accuracy metrics for each approach

5. **Insights and Findings**:
   - Discovers that song lyrics contribute minimally to classification accuracy
   - Achieves state-of-the-art results with accuracies between 0.75 and 0.80

### Implementation Details

- Uses Python-based machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
