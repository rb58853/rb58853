# Building Roads Problem

## Overview

This project addresses the classic problem of building roads on a weighted graph. The goal is to maximize the total weight of the selected edges while ensuring that all vertices connected by these edges are also included in the solution.

### Problem Statement

Given a weighted graph G(v, e), where v represents vertices and e represents edges, the objective is to find a subgraph that maximizes the sum of edge weights minus the sum of vertex weights. Additionally, if an edge belongs to the solution subgraph, both vertices connected by it must also belong to the subgraph.
