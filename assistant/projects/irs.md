# Information Retrieval System

## Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced Information Retrieval System (IRS) for text documents. It incorporates several cutting-edge techniques to enhance precision and efficiency in document retrieval.

### Key Features

- Vector Models
- Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
- Vaswani Attention
- Trie Structures for Document Indexing

### Technologies Used

- Python

### Skills Demonstrated

- IRS Implementation
- Advanced Data Structures (Trie)
- Natural Language Processing Techniques

### Description

The IRS employs a vector-based approach to represent documents and queries in a multidimensional space. This allows for efficient similarity calculations using distance or cosine measures. 

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is utilized to extract semantic features, addressing challenges like synonymy and polysemy. The system also incorporates Vaswani attention to capture complex word relationships, improving overall accuracy by considering broader contexts.

A Trie structure is implemented for indexing and grouping documents, enabling near-instantaneous retrieval based on specific search patterns. This combination of techniques results in a robust and scalable information retrieval system capable of handling large volumes of data effectively.
