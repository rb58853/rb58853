# Azul Game Simulation in Prolog

## Overview

This project simulates the popular board game Azul (also known as Blue) using the declarative programming language Prolog. The goal is to recreate the core gameplay mechanics and rules of the physical version of the game.

### Key Features

- Tile Placement Mechanics
- Scoring Based on Patterns and Sequences
- Player Configuration Management

### Technologies Used

- Prolog

### Skills Demonstrated

- Declarative Programming
- Game Rule Modeling
- Logical Reasoning
- Automated Inference

### Description

The Azul game simulation in Prolog implements the fundamental rules of the game, including:

1. **Rule Definition**:
   - Establishes game rules as facts and logical rules in Prolog
   - Enables direct interpretation of game mechanics and victory conditions

2. **Turn Simulation**:
   - Implements logic for game turns
   - Allows players to select tiles from virtual factories
   - Enforces game restrictions on tile placement

3. **Point Calculation**:
   - Develops modules for automatic point calculation
   - Calculates points at the end of each round and the entire game
   - Determines scores based on tile positions on player boards

4. **User Interface**:
   - Creates a simple text-based interface
   - Allows users to interact with the simulation
   - Displays the current state of the game

### Implementation Details

- Uses Prolog's declarative nature to define game rules and logic
- Leverages Prolog's automatic inference capabilities
- Employs Prolog's built-in predicates for list manipulation and pattern matching

### Benefits of Using Prolog

- Clear and concise definition of game rules
- Automatic deduction of game states and outcomes
- Efficient representation of complex game logic
